**Unit 6: Market Structure: Competitive and Non-competitive Markets**
<span id="6"></span> 
*This unit will introduce the concept of perfect competition,
an “ideal” model that serves as a benchmark against which real-world
market structures are analyzed.  Also known as the model of “pure
competition,” perfect competition results in an efficient allocation of
resources.  In the real world, however, unregulated markets (which are
central to perfect competition) may fail to create desired outcomes for
a number of reasons.  Economists refer to these situations as examples
of imperfect competition.  
  
 In this unit, we will first study the Model of Perfect Competition and
then move on to what may be considered the antithesis of perfect
competition, the Monopoly Model.  We will then learn about imperfect
competition and the two models that fall under it: Monopolistic
Competition and Oligopoly.  We will also touch upon game theory through
the Prisoner’s Dilemma model and a discussion of the Nash Equilibrium.*

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

     Instructions: Read this chapter, including the introduction.
    Understanding the model of Perfect Competition is crucial to your
    understanding of the more complicated and realistic models that will
    be studied next. Please take a moment to read through the stated
    learning outcomes for this chapter of the text, which you can find
    at the beginning of each section. These should be your goals as you
    read through the chapter.  This reading covers subunits
    6.1.1-6.1.4.  
      
     Reading this chapter should take approximately 2 hours and 30
    minutes.

     Instructions: Please go through this 35-minute tutorial to examine
    a model of a firm in a perfectly competitive market.  With the help
    of demand curves, revenue curves, and cost curves, the tutorial will
    also teach you how demand in the market affects firm behavior and
    how an industry supply curve can be derived from the model of the
    perfectly competitive firm.

**6.3 Imperfect Competition** <span id="6.3"></span> 
*Note: We have studied two extreme forms of market structure* – *one
with infinite producers (perfect competition) and one with a single
producer (monopoly).  Realistically, within the spectrum of these two
models, the vast majority of firms exist in an imperfectly competitive
setting where at least one firm is a price setter.  We will now study
two other broad categories in the world of imperfect competition: one in
which many firms compete (monopolistic competition* – *for example, the
market for restaurants in a city) and another in which few firms compete
(oligopoly* – *for example, the cell phone industry).*
