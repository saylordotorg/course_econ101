**Unit 4: The Consumer** <span id="4"></span> 
*This unit will focus on the individual consumer and the characteristics
that compel a consumer (to choose) to spend income on goods and
services.  The consumer experiences utility* – *a measure of
satisfaction* – *with every purchase he/she makes, and economists
measure that utility in order to find a consumer’s optimal rate of
consumption.  The Theory of Demand is derived from the Theory of
Consumer Behavior presented in this section.  An individual's demand
function can be explained by two approaches that help illustrate
personal preferences: Utility Analysis and Indifference Analysis.  We
will explore these concepts more fully in this unit.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 14.25 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.2: 4.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Activity: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Assessments: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Unit Review: 0.75 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Demonstrate an ability to recognize the basic tenets of consumer
    theory through two alternate approaches: the utility analysis and
    the indifference analysis.
-   Correlate the derivation of the theory of demand to the theory of
    consumer behavior.

     Instructions: Please make use of these three interactive online
    exercise sets to better understand the concepts in Utility Theory. 
    You will need a paper and pen to practice sketching the graphs.  The
    first two exercises will enable you to draw the Budget Constraint
    (BC) and Indifference Curves (IC) based on the values of the
    parameters you have chosen.  Change the values of the original
    parameters to see how the BC and IC also change.  As you go along,
    ask why these shifts might be occurring.  In the last exercise, you
    will combine the BC and IC to determine optimization.  Please ensure
    you answer the questions at the end of each exercise.  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 2 hours.  
      
     *Note: These interactive exercises were prepared and presented by
    Dr. Sanjay Paul for the Midwest Conference on Student Learning in
    Economics: Innovation, Assessment and Classroom Research in Akron,
    Ohio on November 7, 2003.*
