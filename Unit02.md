**Unit 2: Supply and Demand** <span id="2"></span> 
*This unit will first introduce you the* ceteris paribus *assumption,
which is crucial to building correlations between economic variables.
 When using* ceteris paribus*, we assume that all variables* – *with the
exception of those in explicit consideration* – *will remain constant. 
We will then examine the supply and demand models and the resulting
market equilibrium that occurs where the supply curve and the demand
curve intersect.  We will also look at what causes movements along the
curve and the set of factors that cause the curves to shift, affecting
both price and quantity, before discussing the meaning and significance
of elasticity.*  
  
 *Next, we will take a look at what happens when a market fails to
produce a reasonable equilibrium.  This situation typically occurs when
either the market is not competitive or complete, or its participants
are ill-informed.  We will evaluate various ways in which the government
can address these failures and begin to understand the intricate
relationship between government and economics.*

**2.1 The Ceteris Paribus Assumption** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*Note: The Latin phrase “ceteris paribus” means “all other things
remaining equal.”  Because there are multiple factors influencing any
one variable, we apply this assumption in order to segregate the effect
that one factor has on the variable in the question, keeping all other
factors unchanged.  In other words, if we want to examine the effect of
one (independent) variable on another (dependent) variable, we need to
ensure through the ceteris paribus assumption that the effect of other
independent variables on the dependent variable is constant.  We will
encounter this term quite often in Demand and Supply Models.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above to learn the formal
    definition of ceteris paribus.  As a practice exercise, identify a
    variable and list the multiple factors that may be influencing it. 
    For example, say you are planning to request an increase in your
    salary.  What are the factors that influence your salary?  Do you
    think you can attribute the change in your salary to any *one* of
    these factors if all of the factors influencing it were
    simultaneously changing?

**2.2.1 The Demand Curve** <span id="2.2.1"></span> 
*Note: The demand curve shows the relationship between the price of a
good and the quantity demanded at each price.  The demand curve is
negatively sloped because of the inverse relationship between price and
quantity demanded.  For example, assuming that the ceteris paribus
condition applies, i.e. all other factors affecting demand remain
unchanged, if the price of an iPhone drops, what do you think will
happen to the demand for the iPhone?  Conversely, if the price
increases, would more people be buying the iPhone or less?*

**2.2.2 Changes in Demand** <span id="2.2.2"></span> 
*Note: Pay special attention to *“*movement along the
curve*”* versus *“*shifts of the curve.*”*  The former refers to changes
in the quantity demanded due to price changes.  The latter refers to the
breakdown of the* ceteris paribus *condition.  In order to understand
shifts in demand curve, you need to know that price remains constant and
the shift of the demand curve is in response to changes in other factors
that affect demand, including changes in the prices of related goods,
changes in income, changes in tastes, and changes in expectations.*  
  
 *The resulting effect is that a rightward shift of the curve indicates
an *“*increase in demand*”* and signifies that at any given price,
consumers demand a larger quantity of the good than before, while a
“decrease in demand” refers to a leftward shift of the curve and
signifies that at any given price, consumers demand a smaller quantity
of the good than before.*

**2.3.1 The Supply Curve** <span id="2.3.1"></span> 
*Note: The supply curve is a mirror reflection of the demand curve.  You
should recognize that the supply curve operates from the firm’s point of
view, such that if a product is highly priced, the firm will want to
supply more of it.  As such, it is a positively sloped curve indicating
the positive relationship between price of the good and quantity
supplied.*

**2.3.2 Changes in Supply** <span id="2.3.2"></span> 
*Note: The demand curve is similar to the supply curve in that an
“increase” refers to a rightward shift of the curve and signifies that
there will be a larger quantity of the good than before; a “decrease in
supply” refers to a leftward shift of the curve and signifies that there
will be a lesser quantity of the good than before.  This section will
present the three principal factors that shift the supply curve: changes
in input prices, changes in technology, and changes in expectations.*

**2.4 Market Equilibrium** <span id="2.4"></span> 
*Note: When left alone, a market will move to equilibrium* – *in other
words, the market price will move to the level at which the quantity
supplied equals the quantity demanded.  However, this outcome can be
both desirable and undesirable for buyers or sellers.*
