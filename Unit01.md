**Unit 1: Introduction to Economics: What Is It?** <span id="1"></span> 
*Before we dive into the principles of microeconomics, we need to define
some of the major ideas that lie at the heart of economics.  What, for
example, is “the economic way of thinking”?  What do economists mean
when they throw around terms like “market structure” and “the invisible
hand”?  This unit will identify and define these terms before addressing
the driving principle behind microeconomics: the idea that individuals
and firms (economic agents) make rational choices based on
self-interest.  These decisions are necessary because all resources are
scarce* – *in other words, no good or item is infinitely available. 
This unit will also introduce you to a number of economic models, the
assumptions and constraints associated with each, and the ways they help
us better understand real-life situations.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 10.75 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐     Subunit 1.1: 4 hours  
  
 ☐     Subunit 1.2: 3.5 hours  
  
 ☐     Subunit 1.3: 0.5 hours  
  
 ☐     Assessments: 2.75 hours

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Think intuitively about economic problems.
-   Identify how individual economic agents make rational choices given
    scarce resources and know how to optimize the use of resources at
    hand.
-   Apply the concept of marginal analysis in order to make optimal
    choices and identify whether the choices are “efficient” or
    “equitable.”
-   Demonstrate an understanding of some simplistic economic models
    related to production, trade, and the circular flow of resources.

**1.1 Individual Choice: The Core of Economics** <span id="1.1"></span> 
**1.1.1 Scarce Resources, Choices, and Opportunity Costs** <span
id="1.1.1"></span> 
*Note: The concept of opportunity cost is critical to understanding
individual choice because you always have to give up something in order
to get another thing.  In other words, the real cost of purchasing “good
A” is equal to the value of the next best alternative (“good B”) that
you give up in order to purchase “good A.”  For example, what would you
rather be doing instead of studying this course?  The task that you have
forgone in order to study economics is the opportunity cost of studying
economics.*

     Instructions: Read  “The Economic Problem” to learn about the basic
    problem of scarcity and the difference between "needs” and "wants.”
     Next, read section 1 in chapter 1 of *Principles of Microeconomics*
    to encounter the three fundamental questions that economists face
    and to learn about “Opportunity Costs.”  Go through the three
    examples presented in the “Try It” section and note how eventually
    every decision boils down to choosing between competing
    alternatives.

     Instructions: This is an optional lecture and not a requirement of
    the course.  In this unit, you learned that scarce resources
    underlie every economic decision that is made in society.  You also
    learned that because of these scarce resources, there are trade-offs
    between alternate choices.  In this guest lecture, Bjorn Lomborg
    advances this idea by discussing some pressing issues that need to
    be addressed.  This talk should help you to identify “the economic
    way of thinking” which will be elaborated upon in the next
    subunit.  
      
     Watching this lecture should take approximately 20 minutes.

*Note: In this subunit, you will examine three introductory models that
economists use to analyze the world.  These should show you how to
“think like an economist.”*

    can find at the beginning of each section.  These should be your

     The first section of the chapter introduces you to the four factors
    of production that are present in the economy: Labor, Capital,
    Natural Resources, and Entrepreneurship.  Using any two factors of
    production, you can then learn to construct the Production
    Possibility Frontier (PPF) in a two plane model.  Note the economic
    implications of the downward slope and the bowed-out shape of the
    PPF curve.  Also note the meaning of producing on the curve versus
    inside the curve.  Lastly, think about what it means to move along
    the curve.

**1.2.2 Comparative Advantage vs. Absolute Advantage** <span

*Note: This model is an application of the Production Possibility
Frontier studied in the previous section, albeit in a global set-up. 
The argument for international trade, specialization, comparative
advantage, and the resulting economic growth is brought to light here. 
The mechanics of comparative advantage will reveal why it would benefit
a country to import goods it produces at home.*
