Course Syllabus for "ECON101: Principles of Microeconomics"
-----------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this course is to provide you with a basic understanding
of the principles of microeconomics.  At its core, the study of
economics deals with the choices and decisions that have to be made in
order to manage scarce resources available to us.  Microeconomics is the
branch of economics that pertains to decisions made at the individual
level, i.e. by individual consumers or individual firms, after
evaluating resources, costs, and tradeoffs.  When we talk about “the
economy,” then, we are referring to the marketplace or system in which
these choices interact with one another.  In this course, we will learn
how and why these decisions are made and how they affect one another in
the economy. Each of the following units has been designed as a building
block, where the concepts you learn in one unit will enable you to
understand the material you discover in the next.  By the end of this
course, you will have a strong grasp on the major issues that face
microeconomists, including consumer and producer behavior, the nature of
supply and demand, the different kinds of markets and how they function,
and the welfare outcomes of consumers and producers.  You will also be
able to apply the formal principles you learn to real world issues.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:  

-   Think intuitively about economic problems.
-   Identify how individual economic agents make rational choices given
    scarce resources and will know how to optimize the use of resources
    at hand.
-   Understand some simplistic economic models related to Production,
    Trade, and the Circular Flow of Resources.
-   Analyze and apply the mechanics of Demand and Supply for
    Individuals, Firms, and the Market.
-   Apply the concept of Marginal Analysis in order to make optimal
    choices and identify whether the choices are “efficient” or
    “equitable.”
-   Apply the concept of Elasticity as a measure of responsiveness to
    various variables.
-   Identify the characteristic differences between various market
    structures, namely, Perfectly Competitive Markets, Non-Competitive
    Markets, and Imperfectly Competitive Markets and understand the
    differences in their operation.
-   Analyze how the Demand and Supply technique works for the Resource
    Markets.

### Course Information

Welcome to ECON101: Principles of Microeconomics!  Below you will read
pertinent information on this course, its resources, and its
requirements.  
  
 **Course Designer:** [Professor Tony
Pizur](http://www.saylor/faculty-o-t/#ProfessorTonyPizur) & [Dr. Bob
McKizzie](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-h-n/#DrBobMcKizzie)  
  
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials.  In general, this course is built around the
basic concepts in microeconomics. There are textbooks, videos, and
self-quizzes to help you learn.  The following resources are most
prominently used:  

-   [Khan Academy Videos in
    microeconomics](http://www.khanacademy.org/#microeconomics)
-   [*Principles of
    Microeconomics*](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Microeconomics.pdf)

**Requirements for Completion:** You are expected to read each unit and
the assigned readings and videos provided.  Throughout the course, there
are quizzes which will enable you to properly frame the assigned
material within the overall objectives for the unit and for the course.
 At the end of the final unit, there is a Final Exam that must be
completed.  Please note that you will only receive an official grade on
your Final Exam.  In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn
a 70% or higher on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be
tabulated as soon as you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you
may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **123.75
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and determine how much time you have over
the next few weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 11.25 hours.  Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a
total of 3.25 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.2 (a total of 3 hours)
on Tuesday night, and so forth.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions:** Economics uses a variety of ways to express
ideas.  As you study each concept, think about how you might explain the
principle using math, words, and/or pictures.  Consider how the graphs
relate to the words and how much information is contained in them.  Be
sure to take notes as you go along because the final exam is
comprehensive.
