**Unit 7: Resource Markets** <span id="7"></span> 
*This unit outlines how firms decide how much they will use their
resources (which include land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurial
ability – all of which are required to produce the final good) and at
what price.  The demand for resources is derived from the demand for the
final goods that are produced with them.  For example, if the demand for
automobiles (the final good) were to increase, the demand for steel (and
any other resource used in the production of the auto) would also
increase.*
