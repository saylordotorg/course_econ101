**Unit 5: The Producer** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, we will learn about one of the most important economic
agents: the producer.  The producer (firm) is responsible for creating
the production function (output) and is subject to various cost measures
as well as the results of diminishing returns.  We will explore these
ideas more fully as we delve into the relationship between quantity of
input and quantity of output and discuss how and why a firm’s costs may
differ in the short-run versus the long-run.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 8.75 hours to complete.

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the behavior of the producer.
-   Compare the costs of production in the short run to costs of
    production in the long run.
