**Unit 3: Markets and Individual Maximizing Behavior** <span
id="3"></span> 
*This unit will examine the ways in which markets increase overall
welfare through the concepts of consumer and producer surplus.  We will
discuss the concepts of marginal costs and benefits and take a look at
how they affect a firm’s decision on whether or not to make one more or
one less product.*  
  
 *We have already learned that, at its most fundamental level,
microeconomics is the study of how we make decisions.  To expand on this
point, we need to distinguish between the “either/or” decision and the
“how much” decision.  You will find this concept useful when looking
more closely at why firms produce certain levels of output, taking into
consideration opportunity cost and sunk (fixed) cost.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 5.25 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.1: 2 hours

 ☐    Assessments: 1.25 hours

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

    and 2”**

    2”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Microeconomics.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read section 1 to revisit the concept of Marginal
    Costs and Benefits within the context of the consumer’s (and the
    firm’s) maximizing behavior.  Proceed to section 2, which defines
    two new concepts: “Consumer Surplus” and “Producer Surplus.”  Please
    take a moment to read through the stated learning outcomes for this
    chapter of the text, which you can find at the beginning of each
    section.  These should be your goals as you read through the
    chapter.  
      
     Reading these sections should take approximately 1 hour and 30

     Instructions: Watch this video about how an apple farmer decides
    the optimal number of apples to pick. At the end of the video,
    consider whether or not the government should intervene. Think about
    which arguments you might make both supporting and disagreeing with
    the government acting in the market. In 3.2, we will cover specific
    ways the government might participate in the market.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take

**3.2 When Markets Fail** <span id="3.2"></span> 
*Note: “Market failure” refers to a situation in which there is an
inefficient allocation of goods and services in the market.  Inefficient
allocation takes place when pure self-interest drives the maximizing
behavior of economic agents.  Market failure is attributed to the
existence of Externalities, Common Property Resources, Public Goods, and
Asymmetric Information.  Market failure often leads to government
intervention designed to drive the market towards efficiency.*
